John Walker, currenlty working for Generanl Motors in the Austin IT Innovation Center.  I on the Solutions Delivery Team that supports Manufacturing, I primarily deliver Linux systems.  I have been with General Motors just over 3 years.  I worked at Dell for 14 years where I did server support of Novell Servers in Manufacturing.
